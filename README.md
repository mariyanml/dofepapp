A set of one Docker containter that forms a simple web application.

For a successful completion you have to:
 - (re)build the image;
 - (re)push the image;
 - (re)run the container;
 - (re)apply the changes on the running application;

The above process should be triggered either manually or based on a commit (fork/clone the project to account under your control).

Use the two **docker-compose.yml** and **docker-compose-alt.yml** files as a starting point when building the final set of application configuration files (or one big file) for the platform of your choice. You can use a tool to prepare and then modify the set of files, or do the entire process manually. Check the file in **yaml** folder.
